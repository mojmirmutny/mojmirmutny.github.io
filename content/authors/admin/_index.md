I am PhD student at ETH Zurich under supervisior of [Andreas Krause](https://las.inf.ethz.ch/krausea) in [Learning and Adaptive Systems group](https://las.inf.ethz.ch/). My research focuses on optimization methods for machine learning, and machine learning methods used as optimization tools among other things. I work mostly on Experimental design, Active Learning and Bandit Algorithms.
