 abstract = {We propose a parallel stochastic Newton method (PSN) for minimizing unconstrained
smooth convex functions. We analyze the method in the strongly convex case, and give

conditions under which acceleration can be expected when compared to its serial counter-
part. We show how PSN can be applied to the large quadratic function minimization in

general, and empirical risk minimization problems. We demonstrate the practical efficiency
of the method through numerical experiments and models of simple matrix classes.},
