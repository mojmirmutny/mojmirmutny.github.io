abstract: We propose a parallel stochastic Newton method (PSN) for minimizing unconstrained
  smooth convex functions. We analyze the method in the strongly convex case, and
  give  conditions under which acceleration can be expected when compared to its serial
  counter- part. We show how PSN can be applied to the large quadratic function minimization
  in  general, and empirical risk minimization problems. We demonstrate the practical
  efficiency of the method through numerical experiments and models of simple matrix
  classes.
