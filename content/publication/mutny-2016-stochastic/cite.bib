 abstract = {A stochastic iterative algorithm approximating second-order information using von Neumann series is discussed. We present convergence guarantees for strongly-convex and smooth functions. Our analysis is much simpler in contrast to a similar algorithm and its analysis, LISSA. The algorithm is primarily suitable for training large scale linear models, where the number of data points is very large. Two novel analyses, one showing space independent linear convergence, and one showing conditional quadratic convergence are discussed. In numerical experiments, the behavior of the error is similar to the second-order algorithm L-BFGS, and improves the performance of LISSA for quadratic objective function.},
