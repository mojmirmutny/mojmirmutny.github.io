abstract: We present the first approach for learning--from a single trajectory--a
  linear quadratic regulator (LQR), even for unstable systems, without knowledge of
  the system dynamics and without requiring an initial stabilizing controller. Our
  central contribution is an efficient algorithm--emph eXploration--that quickly identifies
  a stabilizing controller. Our approach utilizes robust System Level Synthesis (SLS),
  and we prove that it succeeds in a constant number of iterations. Our approach can
  be used to initialize existing algorithms that require a stabilizing controller
  as input. When used in this way, it yields a method for learning LQRs from a single
  trajectory and even for unstable systems, while suffering at most  regret.
