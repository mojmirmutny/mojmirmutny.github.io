abstract: Coresets are small data summaries that are sufficient for model training.
  They can be maintained online, enabling efficient handling of large data streams
  under resource constraints. However, existing constructions are limited to simple
  models such as k-means and logistic regression. In this work, we propose a novel
  coreset construction via cardinality-constrained bilevel optimization. We show how
  our framework can efficiently generate coresets for deep neural networks, and demonstrate
  its empirical benefits in continual learning and in streaming settings.
