(2016) for smooth and convex objectives, which uses random coordinate blocks of a Hessian-over-approximation matrix $bM$ instead of the true Hessian. The convergence analysis of the algorithm is challenging because of its complex dependence on the structure of $bM$. However, we show that when the coordinate blocks are sampled with probability proportional to their determinant, the convergence rate depends solely on the eigenvalue distribution of matrix $bM$, and has an analytically tractable form. To do so, we derive a fundamental new expectation formula for determinantal point processes. We show that determinantal sampling allows us to reason about the optimal subset size of blocks in terms of the spectrum of $bM$. Additionally, we provide a numerical evaluation of our analysis, demonstrating cases where determinantal sampling is superior or on par with uniform sampling.","tags":null,"title":"Convergence Analysis of Block Coordinate Algorithms with Determinantal Sampling","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Mojmir Mutný","Johannes Kirschner","Andreas Krause"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1580515200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1580515200,"objectID":"f83907aca901d104ed36435314c941e7","permalink":"https://mojmirmutny.github.io/publication/mutny-2020/","publishdate":"2020-04-02T12:32:37.960482Z","relpermalink":"/publication/mutny-2020/","section":"publication","summary":"Bayesian optimization and kernelized bandit algorithms are widely used techniques for sequential black box function optimization with applications in parameter tuning, control, robotics among many others. To be effective in high dimensional settings, previous approaches make additional assumptions, for example on low-dimensional subspaces or an additive structure. In this work, we go beyond the additivity assumption and use an orthogonal projection pursuit regression model, which strictly generalizes additive models. We present a two-stage algorithm motivated by experimental design to first decorrelate the additive components. Subsequently, the bandit optimization benefits from the statistically efficient additive model. Our method provably decorrelates the fully additive model and achieves optimal sublinear simple regret in terms of the number of function evaluations. To prove the rotation recovery, we derive novel concentration inequalities for linear regression on subspaces. In addition, we specifically address the issue of acquisition function optimization and present two domain dependent efficient algorithms. We validate the algorithm numerically on synthetic as well as real-world optimization problems.","tags":null,"title":"Experimental Design for Optimization of Orthogonal Projection Pursuit Models","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Johannes Kirschner","Mojmir Mutný","Nicole Hiller","Rasmus Ischebeck","Andreas Krause"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1559347200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1559347200,"objectID":"4e18e812d151f86eb355a9a93f0e3fb8","permalink":"https://mojmirmutny.github.io/publication/kirschner-2019-linebo/","publishdate":"2020-04-02T12:32:37.961322Z","relpermalink":"/publication/kirschner-2019-linebo/","section":"publication","summary":"Bayesian optimization is known to be difficult to scale to high dimensions, because the acquisition step requires solving a non-convex optimization problem in the same search space. In order to scale the method and keep its benefits, we propose an algorithm (LineBO) that restricts the problem to a sequence of iteratively chosen one-dimensional sub-problems. We show that our algorithm converges globally and obtains a fast local rate when the function is strongly convex. Further, if the objective has an invariant subspace, our method automatically adapts to the effective dimension without changing the algorithm. Our method scales well to high dimensions and makes use of a global Gaussian process model. When combined with the SafeOpt algorithm to solve the sub-problems, we obtain the first safe Bayesian optimization algorithm with theoretical guarantees applicable in high-dimensional settings. We evaluate our method on multiple synthetic benchmarks, where we obtain competitive performance.

As tool for global optimization with noisy evaluations, Bayesian optimization was recently shown to outperform alternative methods. By learning a model of the underlying function using all available data, the next evaluation can be chosen carefully to find the optimum with as few steps as possible and without violating any safety constraints. However, the per-step computation time increases significantly with the number of parameters and the generality of the approach can lead to slow convergence on functions that are easier to optimize. To overcome these limitations, we divide the global problem into sequential subproblems that can be solved efficiently using safe Bayesian optimization. This allows us to trade off local and global convergence and to adapt to additional structure in the objective function. Further, we provide slice-plots of the function as user feedback during the optimization. We showcase how we use our algorithm to tune up the FEL output of SwissFEL with up to 40 parameters simultaneously, and reach convergence within reasonable tuning times in the order of 30 minutes (","tags":null,"title":"Bayesian Optimization for Fast and Safe Parameter Tuning of SwissFEL","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Javier Tapia","Espen Knoop","Mojmir Mutnỳ","Miguel A Otaduy","Moritz Bächer"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1546300800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1546300800,"objectID":"c6c10493fdce7d4f934d95da869470cd","permalink":"https://mojmirmutny.github.io/publication/tapia-2019-makesense/","publishdate":"2020-04-02T12:32:37.968705Z","relpermalink":"/publication/tapia-2019-makesense/","section":"publication","summary":"Soft robots have applications in safe human–robot interactions, manipulation of fragile objects, and locomotion in challenging and unstructured environments.

Our method automatically computes a minimal stretch-receptive sensor network to user-provided soft robotic designs, which is optimized to perform well under a set of user-specified deformation-force pairs. The sensorized robots are able to reconstruct their full deformation state, under interaction forces. We cast our sensor design as a subselection problem, selecting a minimal set of sensors from a large set of fabricable ones, which minimizes the error when sensing specified deformation-force pairs. Unique to our approach is the use of an analytical gradient of our reconstruction performance measure with respect to selection variables. We demonstrate our technique on a bending bar and gripper example, illustrating more complex designs with a simulated tentacle.","tags":null,"title":"MakeSense: Automated Sensor Design for Proprioceptive Soft Robots","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1546214400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1546214400,"objectID":"6bbfdc3a3d5d292dc9c0b936535947a6","permalink":"https://mojmirmutny.github.io/code/qff/","publishdate":"2018-12-31T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/code/qff/","section":"code","summary":"This repository includes the code used in paper:Mojmir Mutny \u0026 Andreas Krause, \"Efficient High Dimensional Bayesian Optimization with Additivity and Quadrature Fourier Features\", NIPS 2018\nIt provides an efficient finite basis approximation for RBF and Matern kernels in low dimensions.","tags":null,"title":"Quadrature Fourier Features (QFF) for Python","type":"code"},{"authors":["Mojmir Mutný","Andreas Krause"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1543622400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1543622400,"objectID":"d5f311b04b2beb842fcf6726e943a8a7","permalink":"https://mojmirmutny.github.io/publication/mutny-2018-b/","publishdate":"2020-04-02T12:32:37.959385Z","relpermalink":"/publication/mutny-2018-b/","section":"publication","summary":"We develop an efficient and provably no-regret Bayesian optimization (BO) algorithm for optimization of black-box functions in high dimensions.
