We generalize this framework to RKHSs, and allow for the linear functional to be only approximately inferred, i.e., with a fixed bias. This scenario captures many important modern applications such as estimation of gradient maps, integrals and solutions to differential equations.

However, existing coreset constructions are highly model-specific and are limited to simple models such as linear regression, logistic regression, and k-means. In this work, we propose a generic coreset construction framework that formulates the coreset selection as a cardinality-constrained bilevel optimization problem.
