However, existing coreset constructions are highly model-specific and are limited to simple models such as linear regression, logistic regression, and k-means.

We assume a generalized additive model with possibly overlapping variable groups. When the groups do not overlap, we are able to provide the first provably no-regretemph polynomial time(in the number of evaluations of the acquisition function) algorithm for solving high dimensional BO. To make the optimization efficient and feasible, we introduce a novel deterministic Fourier Features approximation based on numerical integration with detailed analysis for the squared exponential kernel. The error of this approximation decreasesemph exponentially with the number of features, and allows for a precise approximation of both posterior mean and variance. In addition, the kernel matrix inversion improves in its complexity from cubic to essentially linear in the number of data points measured in basic arithmetic operations.","tags":[],"title":"Efficient High Dimensional Bayesian Optimization with Additivity and Quadrature Fourier Features","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Mojmı́r Mutný","Peter Richtárik"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1514764800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1708268601,"objectID":"fd7fb20a1c9a87626941ed28d1014427","permalink":"https://mojmirmutny.github.io/publication/mutny-2018-a/","publishdate":"2024-02-18T15:03:21.007627Z","relpermalink":"/publication/mutny-2018-a/","section":"publication","summary":"We propose a parallel stochastic Newton method (PSN) for minimizing unconstrained smooth convex functions. We analyze the method in the strongly convex case, and give conditions under which acceleration can be expected when compared to its serial counter-part.
